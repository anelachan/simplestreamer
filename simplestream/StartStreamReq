/*
well u could do something that does either startstream or stopstream
could be parameterized by something...
are we repeating code to much?
but i don't want ToJSON to take an argument.
we could inherit from request and then set some kind of variable...
e.g. have instance var request = startstream or stopstream
which is set in constructor...
i don't want to repeat code but i want things to be clearest
i think it's clear to say
StartStreamReq ssr = new StartStreamRequest();
ssr.ToJSON();

instead of say request = new Request(startstream); ??
request.ToJSON();

esp as there are extra possible fields...?
but those could just be empty instance variables, and we might need 
to set them regardless...
